    <h4> INGREDIENTS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon neutral-flavored oil, such as canola oil</li>
        <li>7 ounces thick-cut bacon or toucinho</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>2 to 4 teaspoons Jasmine tea leaves or any tea of your choice</li>
        <li>loaf of ciabatta or any crusty bread of choice, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4> INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the bacon to the pan and fry until it is crispy on both slides, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Move the bacon to the sides of the pan. Crack the eggs directly into the same pan and cook until the egg whites are set, about 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In an electric kettle or a small saucepan, heat the water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon of tea leaves and the boiling water to each bowl (use 2 to 4 bowls, depending how many people you are feeding). Let the tea steep for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Â Serve all the bacon and eggs family style (in one pan) accompanied with the crusty slices of bread, a hunk of Maasdam cheese or your cheese of choice, and bowl of green tea. This meal can be shared among a small family.</li>
