    <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons salted butter, plus extra for serving</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small vine cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried mixed herbs, such as Robertsons Mixed Herbs or Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup superfine sugar</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes. Allow it to cool completely while you prepare the rest of your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the olive oil over the vine of tomatoes in a small bowl, then season it with the dried mixed herbs or Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Roast the tomatoes on the grill or under the broiler for 6 to 8 minutes, until the tomatoes start to blister.</li>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda until the ingredients are well mixed.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add the buttermilk, egg, vanilla extract, and melted butter.</li>
        <li>Whisk until the batter is well mixed; it may be slightly thick and lumpy. If the batter is too dry, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of extra buttermilk to the batter and stir. The batter should be slightly thick and should pour easily.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of neutral-flavored oil in a medium nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add a scoop of pancake batter to the pan and cook each side for 3 to 4 minutes, until lightly golden brown. Repeat with the rest of the batter, making 4 large pancakes (4 to 5 tablespoons per pancake) or 10 mini-pancakes (2 tablespoons per pancake).</li>
        <li>While the pancakes are cooking, cook your smoked kielbasa sausage according to the package instructions.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes hot between 2 plates, with a small slab of butter, maple syrup, the smoked sausage, and the blistered tomatoes. Enjoy immediately.</li>
